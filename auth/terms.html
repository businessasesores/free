Tonohost does not allow the propagation or distribution of copyright material, files or warez under any circumstances.</p>

<br/>

<h4>8. ACCEPTABLE SERVER RESOURCE USE</h4>
<p>Sites must not use excessive amounts of server resources. These include bandwidth, processor utilization and / or disk space. Please see the 'High Resource Use Policy' in the General Terms and Conditions.</p>

<br/>

<h4>10. SCRIPT USAGE TERMS</h4>
<p>Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and not to use the server as an application server. Using the server to generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of activity that is not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate the timeouts on servers. These are set at the present values to ensure the reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and are therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed to provide proxy services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page. Scripts that send a single email based upon user entered information, or update a database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or perform processor intensive database processes are not allowed. All outgoing mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a Tonohost-hosted domain.</p>
<p>Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server resources, or other sites on the same server</p>
<p>Examples of not allowed script and website types include (but are not limited to):</p>

    <li>Proxy scripts</li>
    <li>Chat scripts</li>
    <li>Bitcoin / cryptocurrency faucet sites</li>

    <li>Autolike scripts</li>
    <li>Hacking scripts / PHP shell scripts</li>

</ol>

<br/>

<h4>11. USAGE OF DISK SPACE TERMS</h4>
<p>Tonohost offers large web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts. By this, we mean space for legitimate web site content and bandwidth for visitors to view it. All files on a domain must be part of the active website and linked to the site. Sites should not contain any backups, downloads, or other non-web based content. We will treat all password protected archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as unacceptable. Multimedia content such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to the user, links to HTTP download of this content is not acceptable.</p>
